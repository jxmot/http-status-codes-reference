# HTTP Status Codes Reference

I found myself keeping a browser tab open to a page containing the status code. The one I **was** using had a decent layout and was it was easy to find the code I needed. But then *someone* took it over and over-complicated the layout so a quick lookup wasn't going to happen any more.

So I created this simple table of HTTP codes. I use it for reference, and the information it contains has been gathered from several sources. 

What's been imported here seemed to make sense (at the time) and provided useful information.

A number of codes are not present but can be added in the future. There are a bunch that are commented out at the end of the `httpcodes.html` file that are ready to use.
